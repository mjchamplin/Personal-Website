        <h2>Challenge:</h2>
        <p>
        As part of their extensive renovations and rebranding, a building in downtown Dallas needed a way to feature new amenities and services and attract prospective tenants.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-6 grid-offset-2">
        <h2>Solution:</h2>
        <p>Prioritizing intuitive navigation and on-brand design, I created a mobile app that combined the client’s distinct needs into a single elegant solution.
        </p>
        <p>
        With user-centric functionality and polished UI, the app enabled tenants to easily access conference room scheduling, hail a local shuttle, submit building work orders, and more.

        <h2>Process:</h2>
        <p>Good design can only happen when the problem is well-defined, so the first step in any design process is research. Conducting interviews and brainstorming sessions help identify both the the client and potential users' needs.</p>

        <p>Next up, many rounds of sketching. I find manual sketching is still the most efficient way to get ideas from my brain to paper. The key to this phase is iteration: sketch sketch sketch until an idea and design begins to form.</p>
