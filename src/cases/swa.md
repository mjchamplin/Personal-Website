        In 2018 I participated in a large-scale research engagement as my team began work to design and build a replacement for a Dallas-based airlineâ€™s operations software. I conducted 15+ contextual inquiries, which were synthesized with over 40 in total, alongside stakeholder interviews and data gathered by 3rd-party analysts. We affinitized over 1,500 data points over the course of two weeks, after which I created personas for existing users along with hypothetical future-state personas; the team also produced an extensive journey map and other deliverables which we presented to various stakeholder groups.
