        <h2>Airline Client</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong>
        My client, a Dallas-based airline, needed to replace its aging proprietary operations software to better support the scale of its modern operation.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        My team conducted and synthesized qualitative research at scale in a uniquely high-stakes environment.
        </p>
        <p>
        I developed comprehensive research outputs that were foundational for the client’s digital transformation goals, including personas, wireframes, and journey maps.
        </p>
        <p>
        A large component of this engagement after research was stakeholder education. I presented our research and recommendations throughout the company and helped various  teams understand the far-reaching implications of our research findings.

        <h2>400 Record</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong>
        As part of their extensive renovations and rebranding, a building in downtown Dallas needed a way to feature new amenities and services and attract prospective tenants. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        Prioritizing intuitive navigation and on-brand design, I created a mobile app that combined the client’s distinct needs into a single elegant solution.
        </p>
        <p>
        With user-centric functionality and polished UI, the app enabled tenants to easily access conference room scheduling, hail a local shuttle, submit building work orders, and more.

        <h2>Home Healthcare Client</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> 
        A home health technology and service company needed to better understand the challenges that faced its clinicians working in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> 
        I conducted virtual interviews with clinicians across the country to understand their pain-points, and audited their onboarding procedure to understand gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
        After synthesizing data from clinician interviews, we identified high-value features that could be added to their app experience to increase clinician productivity and happiness (and reduce turnover).
        </p>
        <p>
        The final piece was creating a priority roadmap, enabling the client to execute future development.

        <h2>Brain Health Startup</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong>
        My client created a first-of-its-kind at-home medical monitoring device designed to monitor sleep and screen for markers indicating increased risk for dementia. They needed to understand how potential users felt about the promise of such a device, and the day-to-day experience. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        With a muti-pronged research and prototyping strategy, I helped the client understand the needs of their potential user-base in order to take their product to market.
        </p>
        <p>
        Through a series of stakeholder workshops, I  guided the client through the discovery phase, followed by storyboard research to understand pain points and opportunities. Finally, my team developed a proof-of-concept app prototype, used to facilitate remote user testing to gather sentiment around key features.
