  <p>I’m a multi-disciplinary designer in Texas. Most recently, I’ve worked in product design consulting, and I’m interested in helping brands and causes tell stories using design and technology. I’ve worked in both research and design execution for over fifteen years.</p>

  <h1>What I’m Looking For</h1>
  <p>After spending a decade in product consulting working with all kinds of clients, I've arrived at a simple truth: I want to use my skills to have a positive impact on peoples’ lives. I'm looking for opportunities to improve inclusion and accessibility in product research and design, contribute to a team that shares my values, and work toward positive change in the world.</p>
