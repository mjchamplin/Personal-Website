  <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>
  <p>After spending a decade in product consulting working with all kinds of clients, I've arrived at a simple truth: I want to use my skills to have a positive impact on peoples’ lives. I'm looking for opportunities to improve inclusion and accessibility in product research and design, contribute to a team that shares my values, and work toward positive change in the world.</p>
