    </p>
    <p>
        The Solution:

            <li>conducted 15+ contextual inquiries, which were synthesized with over 40 in total, alongside stakeholder interviews and data gathered by 3rd-party analysts</li>
            <li>Affinitized over 1,500 data points over the course of two weeks, after which</li>
            <li>I created personas for existing users along with hypothetical future-state personas</li>
            <li>The team also produced an extensive journey map and other deliverables which we presented to various stakeholder groups</li>
        </ul>
