Lately I've been doing some freelance work in both the product and [graphic design](https://dribbble.com/shots/24965011-Ten-of-Cups-Wedding-invitation) spaces. I also redesigned and rebuilt my personal site [by hand](/colophon) (you're looking at it *right now*).

I've been hanging out on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/champl.in) since Twitter became insufferable. I've also started a [journal](/journal) here on the new site, we'll see if it sticks.
