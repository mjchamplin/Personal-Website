# Random Photo Adventure

## A Problem!

I recently indexed the “Photography” folder on my external hard drive, and currently have over 34,000 files there. This doesn’t include photos taken with my phone, which I can’t even think about right now.

I’m always fretting about what to do with my photography. I’m simply *always* taking pictures. I post maybe .05% to Instagram and (occasionally) print a small handful, but the overwhelming majority of them live a quiet life on my external hard drive. There’s something to be said for doing a thing for the mindful joy of doing it, but I think maybe I’m also missing out on part of the experience here.

## A Solution!

I indexed that folder again, saving each filename to a text file, then wrote a python script that picks a file at random from the index and opens it. This is a kind of photographic roulette, I guess?

Anyway my plan is to post one daily on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/photoeveryday.bsky.social">this Bluesky account</a> I created for this purpose<sup>1</sup>. I’m setting the bar low here (and keeping myself honest), so that means

1. I’m not going to re-roll if I don’t like the photo.<sup>2</sup>
2. I may or may not do any editing.
3. Some of the photos may be bad, boring, or absolutely mundane.

So that’s it! I hope you enjoy. But you don’t have to! You’re more than welcome, as always, to silently judge me and my art.

1. I originally did this project <a href="https://instagram.com/michaeljchamplin">on Instagram</a> but don't use that account anymore, largely because of their [draconian approach to images of the human body](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-01/instagram-nyome-nicholas-williams-celeste-barber-censorship/12833526).
2. I won’t post any that violate peoples’ privacy or consent, obviously.
