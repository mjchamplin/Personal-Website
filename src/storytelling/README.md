# Storytelling

This directory functions very similarly to /journal and uses the same content layouts. It's meant as a portfolio and archive of work I categorize as "storytelling" â€” mostly writing, but also editorial work.

## Front Matter

The front matter for these templates supports all the normal use cases (including the `post-big` template) but also has a section for the metadata for the piece. This is the only significant way this directory functions differently than `/journal'.

```
---
title: - Title of piece 
description: - A brief description or tagline for the piece
thumbnail: - A post thumbnail. See /journal for specs
date: (optional) - standard post date
original: - Collected metadata for original piece
   title: - Title of original published location (ie Medium)
   url: - Original source (if applicable)
   date: - Date of original publication
---
```

## Media

Media, including thumbnails, live in `/_assets/img/storytelling`
