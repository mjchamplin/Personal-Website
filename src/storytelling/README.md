# Storytelling

This directory functions very similarly to /journal and uses the same content layouts. It's meant as a portfolio and archive of work I categorize as "storytelling" â€” mostly writing, but also editorial work.

## Front Matter

`title:` - Title of piece 
`description:` - A brief description or tagline for the piece
`thumbnail:` - A post thumbnail. See /journal for specs
`date:` (optional) - standard post date
`original:` - Collected metadata for original piece
`   title:` - Title of original published location (ie Medium)
`   url:` - Original source (if applicable)
`   date:` - Date of original publication
