<em>I'm glad you're here!</em> Here's a bit more about me:
</p>
<p class="p-med">
Progressive, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8ni20hkOE0">design-minded</a>, restless, sometimes activist, <a href="https://photo.mjchamplin.com">photographer</a>, former filmmaker, <a href="/storytelling">writer</a>, zine-maker, general creative-type. Wanderlusty, breakfast food aficionado, a collector of many small things, of words, of experiences. A lover of friendship, of food, of here and there and of the journey between here and there.
</p>
<p class="p-med">
From UX design and art direction to film photography and publishing editorial articles, I'm always exploring new creative endeavors and projects.
