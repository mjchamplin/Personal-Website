Sleeping Ute Mountain as viewed from Cortex, CO just before dawn, December 2018.

This particular morning is sort of a *core memory* for me. I woke before dawn and drove into the emptiness west of Cortez Colorado, watching this solitary mountain as the sun came up, painted in a million different colors before settling on a brilliant blue-white. It was so impossibly, blissfully quiet.
