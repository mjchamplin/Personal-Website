Two weeks after I drove to Tulsa to visit my grandfather (as documented in February’s zine) he passed away peacefully in hospice care at age 91. 

Today was the funeral, and though I don’t really feel the need to eulogize and I’m certainly not fishing for sympathy, it is a milestone I feel like documenting. 

He was my last surviving grandparent. It feels like the existential flip clock has clicked and turned to the next generation. 

Lately I lost a dear friend to cancer, have another who is losing her battle, and yet another who just learned she has it. 

Sometimes it feels like the campfire grows dimmer, the circle of its light smaller, like the shadows grow closer. 

May we all make the very best of our time together in the firelight.
