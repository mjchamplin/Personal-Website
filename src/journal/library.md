Stopped impulsively at the library and walked around. I realized that libraries are just good places for me. I feel good and safe when I'm there.

Afterward I wrote down the things I saw, in no particular order.

- An endcap with materials on becoming a US citizen
- The librarianâ€™s homemade watermelon earrings 
- The section of books for teens on gender and sexuality
- The section of books on Nazi history
- The Diary of Anne Frank 
- A seed library
- Cute moms in Fanny packs (2)
- Librarians _all wearing masks_
